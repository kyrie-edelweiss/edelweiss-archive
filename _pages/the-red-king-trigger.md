## Content Warning – *The Red King*  
*The Red King © 2025 by Kyrie D'Agostino contains intense, graphic, and symbolically complex depictions of trauma, abuse, and power. The story uses nonlinear timelines, metaphysical horror, and recursive storytelling to explore themes of oppression, autonomy, and revolution. Please proceed with caution.*

---

### General Themes  
- **Sexual Violence & Coercion** (Metaphorical & Literal):  
  Graphic depictions of ritualized or coercive rape.

- **Trauma and Dissociation:**  
  Characters dissociate to survive control.

- **Psychological Horror:**  
  Omniscient forces observe the narrative unfold. Many things are left unspoken.

- **Religious & Institutional Abuse:**  
  The Seven Planet Authority (SPA), the Saturnian Faiths, and revolutionary Venus all use religious or ideological doctrine to justify violation, correction, and ritualized control of women.

- **Body Autonomy Violation:**  
  The protagonist’s body is repeatedly stripped of agency by external forces.

- **Narrative Abuse:**  
  The story itself is complicit in the abuse.

---

### Additional Themes  

- **Trans Trauma & Body Politics:**  
  Some characters face misgendering, institutional passing pressure, and dysphoria under state surveillance.

- **Suicidal Ideation / Depersonalization:**  
  Several characters express or embody a longing for nonexistence, narrative erasure, or surrender to void—often as a consequence of abuse cycles.

- **Paranoia, Looping, Surveillance:**  
  The narrative is nonlinear, recursive by design.

- **Cosmic Eroticism & Mythic Horror:**  
  Gods, planets, and entities attempt to possess women through symbolic or literal narrative seduction. The eroticization of annihilation and intimacy with cosmic forces is frequent.

### Reader Discretion is Strongly Advised.  
This narrative is built to disturb, deconstruct, and challenge. It directly critiques systemic violence, patriarchal myth, and narrative complicity in abuse. The author drew inspiration from her past experiences.
