_**AUDIO… ACTIVE**_

The static hums, low and steady, vibrating with tension, like an old machine working itself into oblivion. Beneath the noise, there is something darker—a muffled rhythm of breathing, ragged and desperate. The cries of men, distorted and broken, fill the silence between mechanical growls. Their voices are not sharp—more like the gasps of drowning creatures, their calls twisted into something far less human.

**YOUNG WOMAN** (panting, weeping, laughing):  
_"Fuck—fuck, fuck—I can feel it—I'm so close, I'm so close!"_

**MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN** (fevered, chanting):  
_"Hold him still, Hold him still! Keep his head like that!"_

_**VIDEO… ACTIVE**_

The grainy feed flickers, revealing a room ravaged by time. The walls are cracked, peeling like old skin, the air thick with the smell of decay. The floor is littered with scraps, remnants of something long dead. The light is weak, seeping in through narrow slats, casting a sickly glow that stretches the shadows into grotesque shapes.  

At the center of the room, six women form a circle. Some kneel, some stand, others squat, their postures aggressive, unnatural—like animals closing in on their prey. In the middle, three men are bound to battered chairs, their bodies naked and trembling. The women move around them with ruthless precision, their eyes wild, glazed over with fervor. Every motion is deliberate, but there is no grace—only hunger, a desperation that pushes beyond the bounds of reason.

The men are gagged, bound with thick, soiled linen. They are nothing more than vessels—emptied of their humanity, reduced to objects for the women’s ritual. The air hums with the rhythm of it all: thrusts, screams, cuts, and grunts that blur into one chaotic symphony of violent devotion.

Each stroke, each tear of flesh, each cry from the men is not an act of cruelty—no, it is an offering. Every drop of blood is sacrament. Every scream is a hymn of liberation, a hymn that sings the destruction of everything they have known. The women’s movements are erratic, almost animalistic in their zeal.

_**MOTION… ERROR – EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION**_

**YOUNG WOMAN** (her voice shaken, ecstatic, as though on the brink of madness):  
_"No—no, fuck, this isn’t enough! I need more—it's never enough! More!"_

In the background, an older woman stands alone. Her presence is calm, composed, like the eye of a storm. Her hair is streaked with gray and bound tightly, but her gaze is sharp—calculating. She watches, her eyes filled with the kind of certainty that comes only from true belief.

**OLDER WOMAN** (low, commanding):  
_"Abigail. He is nothing but meat. Tear his cock off. With your teeth."_

**MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN** (weeping, celebratory):  
_"They deserve it—they deserve this! This is what they’ve done to us. This is the only justice we have!"_

The camera lurches suddenly, as though struck by an invisible force. The frame tilts, showing the warped doorframe of the room—scrawled across it, the sigil of Venus, twisted and deformed into an endless spiral.

**YOUNG WOMAN** (suddenly still, whispering):  
_"Wait—"_  
_"Haven’t we done this before? I—I saw this. In a dream. No, not a dream. In another skin."_

**MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN** (snapping at her):  
_"Stay in the moment! Don’t let the loop distract you!"_

_The young woman nods, a small sentiment of doubt creeping into her—but continues anyway._

**OLDER WOMAN** (gravelly, reverent):  
_"Cut him. Slice his throat slowly—don’t rush. Like you’re tracing the lines of a book. Let the blood spray on your breasts."_

The brutality escalates, and the women are no longer women—they are instruments of vengeance, instruments of destruction. Their ecstasy is not sexual—it is a release of everything they've held back for so long. For hours, the recording captures them in a feverish ritual of domination, mutilation, and a perverse devotion to their cause.

By the end of it, the men are unrecognizable—husk-like, their bodies desecrated, drained, and laid bare. Their eyes are still open, their mouths hanging wide, as if they were left in a state of perpetual shock.

**YOUNG WOMAN** (giggling, joyous):  
_"Look at this—this one had a reckorder. Hey, wasn't this one your daddy, Sarah?"_

A girl named Sarah laughs, tears streaming down her face. The two young women collapse into each other’s arms, their bodies slick with blood, their laughter filled with madness—a final, almost sacred release.

Their laughter rings through the desolate room like the tolling of a bell.

A figure steps down the staircase from above—a woman with crimson hair. She moves slowly, deliberately, as though the entire world is beneath her. Unlike the others, she is not disrobed and barefoot. Her presence is one of quiet authority, a force of nature moving in calm defiance of the chaos around her.

She steps forward, unflinching in the face of the destruction, and nods to the elder woman, who watches her with something akin to awe.

**OLDER WOMAN** (softly, reverently):  
_"It’s done? You're sure? Absolutely sure it will work?"_

**REDHEAD** (decided):  
_"Yes. The threshold is cracked. Something is coming—something beautiful."_

**OLDER WOMAN** (softly, half to herself):  
_"If this is the time it works, let her remember. Let her finish it this time."_

She looks to the sigil above the door—spiraling, layered, toothlike. A loop. An ouroboros with no beginning.

**REDHEAD** (louder, with growing fervor):  
_"Those bastards—they will kneel. Their cities will fall. Their tongues will rot in their mouths."_

**REDHEAD** (quiet, resolute):  
_"Something stirs."_

Their gazes linger on the girl in the corner—the youngest of them all, shivering with eyes too wide.  
She will forget this moment.  
They all do.

# Chapter One – A Brief Meeting
**TIMESTAMP:** Early-To-Mid 1976  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** NEPTUNE – Executive Council Chamber, Tower A-Prime  
**CLASSIFICATION:** BLACK CODE – UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL

---

> *"Empires don’t collapse. They consent to their own decay—one executive meeting at a time."*  
> — Anonymous

---

A cohort of twelve high-ranking personnel are positioned equidistantly around a long, mirror-polished black conference table within a spacious, meticulously curated executive chamber. At the helm, a commanding figure presides—posture poised, hands interlaced with practiced composure.  

The figure wears the standardized gray of the executive tier—anonymizing, sexless—her silver nameplate glinting in the overhead fluorescents like a cautionary blade. She does not smile often, but when she does, it is calculated.  

She sits with practiced ease, palms lightly resting on the table’s edge. Her voice is tuned to professional warmth—a shade softer than Hertz’s metallic cadence, but never so soft it could be misread as uncertain.

---

**EDELWEISS** (pleasant, firm):  

“Good morning, gentlemen. My name is **Avery-Mary Edelweiss**, executive director of this board. This is **William Hertz**, my senior strategic officer. I will be conducting roll call while my assistant matches names to faces. Please respond when your name is called."

_Her words are crisp, her cadence refined by decades of institutional leadership. Her voice carries the affect of someone who has long since learned how to suppress both her accent and her allegiance to anything **but** the company._

“That's everyone? Excellent. I hereby declare—the first official **Seven Planet Committee** board meeting is underway.”

*A click is heard as the airlocks seal. She continues, without pause.*

“First, allow me to extend formal commendation.  Your selection was not incidental—your track records have been reviewed, audited, and validated at the highest levels. Let this moment serve as a rare acknowledgment: your contributions are seen. They are appreciated. Well done.”

*A ripple of polite laughter. Applause follows—brief. She does not join in.* 

“The Committee is a direct response to radical sex supremacism.”

*Pause. Silence washes over the room.* 

“The **Seven Planet Authority** has extended generous funding to formalize our department—under one condition, that the Venusian movement falls before 1990. Our mission is paramount—their forces must be nullified & Venus rightfully reclaimed.”  

*The room breaks into structured applause.*  

*She does not smile. She simply nods once—subtle, contained—then signals to her second-in-command.*

“I’ll now hand it over to William, who will provide an overview of the case-by-case situation. He’s a very smart, capable, and passionate man.” 



---



_William Hertz steps forward with measured authority. A low mechanical hum follows as the **reckoner**, embedded into the ceiling panel, activates. The chamber lights dim slightly. A translucent projection materializes on the wall behind him—clean, minimal, and institutional blue._





### SECTOR 1: MERCURY  

**Visual:** A scorched, wind-blasted colony; heat-map overlay in red; massive half-sunken refineries and molten conveyor belts; shattered atmospheric domes; “Threat Vector: Eliminated.”  

**HERTZ**:  

“Mercury was once the SPA's industrial keystone—the prime node for arms production, heavy manufacturing, and exo-alloy synthesis.  Following a sabotage event targeting atmospheric filtration systems, the colony is currently non-viable. No recovery operations are scheduled. While regrettable, the loss neutralizes a significant threat vector. Reconstruction efforts will prioritize enhanced security infrastructure.

*He pauses. The screen flickers.*

**HERTZ**:  

“A moment of silence, please, for all confirmed *client* casualties.”  

*The projection dims to a dark gray, displaying a silent counter of names: 1481 dead.*



### SECTOR 2: VENUS  

**Visual:** Glitched-out industrial landscape—static interference; silhouettes of women holding rifles rendered in black; “1966: Total Comms Loss ... 1969: Final Withdrawal”  

**HERTZ**:  

“Economically designed around a bustling tourism sector fielded by a predominantly female workforce. By 1952, Venus had shifted into the central market of female exports, services and labor. Historical landmarks were destroyed to make room for refineries, markets, and correction facilities. Other sectors would follow with their own variations of the New Venusian Model—on a smaller scale.  

*Pause. Red light is cast over the conference chamber.*

HERTZ: (gesturing)

“The present day situation is critical. The rebellion began around 1955 with linguistic deviation—somehow, the girls learned words we never taught them. Appeasement started in 1957, under Clause 19-C "Right To Name". By 1962, the Venusian revolution entered full swing—they'd organized cells, procured arms from god-knows-where, and converted several facilities into their forward bases. Communications ceased entirely in 1966. All management infrastructure has been destroyed by 1967. Local security assets were extracted in 1969 following the Two Year Stand. From a strategic standpoint, every inhabitant of Venus is now considered a threat and should be dealt with accordingly.”  

*The crimson dims out as the projector subtly distorts, as if infected by the chaos Venus represents.*



### SECTOR 3: EARTH  

**Visual:** Grayscale Earth turning slowly; “DECOMMISSIONED” stamped across its surface, timeline overlay of mass migration off-planet  



**HERTZ**:  (unmoved)

“There is little to address about Earth.*  

“It's no longer a recognized operating territory.*



*Green shifts, then stills. Edelweiss follows. Her thumb grazes the inside of her palm twice. A tell no one has ever commented on.*



### SECTOR 4: MARS  

**Visual:** Red dunes swallowing machines, strange static glyphs appearing momentarily; status reads: “UNEXPLAINED FAILURE”  



**HERTZ**:  

 “Despite its status as our first colonization candidate, every initiative has ended in unexplained failure. It remains unoccupied, and likely will remain so.  

*The reckoner emphasizes a flashing red buffer zone around the planet’s orbit.*

“Fortunately, its remoteness and symbolic importance to the insurgents acts as a natural barrier to ideological contagion.”



### SECTOR 5: JUPITER  

**Visual:** R&D moons in orbit; data streams showing green operational metrics; Callisto marked “UNDER SURVEILLANCE”  

**HERTZ**:  

“Our R&D satellites—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—remain stable and ideologically neutral. We intend to increase funding to maintain their strategic output.”  

*He nods toward the red-pulsing marker on Callisto.*  

**HERTZ**:  

“Minor disturbances have been reported, but remain manageable.”

*Hermann quietly promises he'll take care of it.*



### SECTOR 6: SATURN  

**Visual:** Glowing ring cities with stained-glass hues; fine-print contracts scroll in the corner; stat: “204,239 Faith Centers”

**HERTZ**:  

“Since our departure from Earth, **SATURN** has served as a nexus for spiritual and cultural continuity. The settlements are autonomous and doctrinally rigid. Our presence is limited, bound by longstanding contract. Intervention is neither advised nor welcomed.”

_Lamont, **SATURN**’s representative, gives a brief nod of approval._



### SECTOR 7: URANUS  

**Visual:** A single black Pillar piercing planet core-to-cloud; endless rows of male trainees marching in silence; silhouettes amid masses of men labeled “TARGET – EXECUTE”



**HERTZ**:  

“Our central defense contractor training site. The Pillar spans from planetary core to upper atmosphere and lower atmosphere. This is an exclusively-male sector.”  

*The reckoner highlights internal maps of training regimens and punishment queues.*  

“Execution protocols are in place for any suspected sympathizer of Venusian ideology. With proper oversight, further action will be minimal.”  

*Kildare, ex-military, remains stone-faced.*



### SECTOR 8: NEPTUNE  

**Status:** CRITICAL // CURRENT LOCATION  

**Visual:** A world-spanning metropolis; stacked architecture like corporate files, sprawling underground nerve-map; a blinking green dot marks their current position

**HERTZ**:  

“Our administrative capital. Beneath the surface lies a vast bureaucratic nerve center—synchronization at full capacity. Every directive, every protocol, begins here.”  

*The reckoner zooms in on interlinking tunnel paths and encrypted communication feeds, painting a network of control.*

“This is our current position. If **NEPTUNE** falls,” he pauses, letting the final slide pulse, “we all fall.”



_A standing ovation erupts, echoing through the grand chamber. The reckoner slowly fades to black, leaving only the emblem of the **Seven Planet Committee** hovering midair like a watchful eye._

*She sat alone after the meeting. Ten minutes. No movement.*  

# Chapter Two - Katherina
**KATHERINA SERIES**  
**YEAR OF RECORD:** Early 1984  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Former Commune Zone, Southern Acid Belt  
**STATUS:** Person of Interest

---

There were many dwellers within the expanse of space—some bearing names that rang like chimes through the ancient ether, others nameless, faceless things, whose presence could only be felt in the tremble of matter and thought. These watchers had lingered in the void long before Earth’s first radio wave pulsed outward. They had seen empires rise from dust and fall into ash across the breadth of the stars.

They bore witness, too, when humanity—bleeding, burning, desperate—fled its ruined cradle and scattered itself like pollen into the endless black.

And then there once was a young woman—**Katherina.**

The nights were long now, longer than they had any right to be. Out here, in this forgotten corridor of the cosmos, light was a dying thing. The stars no longer comforted; they glared down like indifferent gods with eyes that had long since turned away. The sky was *blacker than black,* not empty, but *hollow.* 

Her life unfolded in a flickering chamber of pale phosphorus light. The phosphorus would hum incessantly - and when it did go silent, she could almost hear her thoughts echo.

She subsisted on her stale canned food reserve. She read brittle books by the soft white light, old words etched by forgotten hands. Every now and then she allowed herself a small indulgence—her signature mixed tea brewed from what remains of the local herbs, laced with syrup that she rationed like it was blood. The sweetness made her cry sometimes.

And when she could gather the strength, she would drag her body across the frost-rimed landscape or derelict neighborhoods and bunkers, calling out for voices that never answered. Her search stretched across months, across years, across the brittle thread of her sanity.

Katherina had grown quieter.

Her voice cracked when she tried to hum. Her muscles forgot the rhythm of walking. Even silence became too loud.

Then, one afternoon, deep in the shattered hull of a collapsed ration vault… she found a wall.

Not just a wall—a *mirror*, in the way some walls reflect without light. The surface was layered in ash and resin, but something had been scratched into it with the edge of a blade. Dozens of lines, spirals, symbols she didn’t recognize… except one.

*Her name.*

_KATHERINA._  
Scratched over and over, by different hands.

And just beneath one of the carvings, in a trembling script that matched her own—was a short message:

_“If you’re reading this, I tried. I really did. Don’t say his name.”_

She stared at the words for a long time.

Then she wrote one of her own beside it:

_“I won’t. I promise.”_

She pressed her forehead to the metal and wept—not from fear, but from the bone-deep, awful *recognition* of being one version in a line of broken girls trying to make something stick.

But sometimes, when sleep found her in its gentler moods, Katherina would dream.

She would dream of two women—one young and golden-haired, the other older, her face scarred and her hair red like beetroot. They held her, fed her, whispered words not in any Earthern tongue. She remembered the smell of oil and incense, the soft scratch of robes, the heat of hands on her forehead.

And when the dreams faded—when she woke to the silence and the metal and the frost—something inside her *broke further.*

One night, when her thoughts became too loud and the darkness too vast, Katherina would step into the lightless deadzone of her abode sheltered from the encroach of the phosphorus-light. Her breath was foggy. She dropped to her knees.

Kneeling, she turned her eyes to the stars—not in reverence, but in desperation. Her voice, hoarse from disuse, cracked as she pleaded to the celestial spheres, to the husks of constellations, to the _absent light of the **SUN**._

There was no answer.

Only silence. The kind that weighs.

And then her thoughts spiral from there:

*"I hope someone visits me soon.*  
*That's what I need.*  
*I won’t be alone anymore.*  
*When they come visit me…*  
*I won’t be so cold.*  
*It’ll be nice.*  
*I can't be alone anymore.*  
*I hope someone visits me soon.*  
*I won't be alone anymore."*

She repeated these words like scripture. Like a mantra carved into her soul by frostbitten fingers.

And time—patient, cruel, unending—marched on.

No voice ever came. No warmth returned. The world she once knew was dust, the people she once loved were myth, and the stars were no longer storytellers, only tombstones.

Her loneliness metastasized into something deeper. Not merely a want for company—but a *hunger* for purpose, for meaning, for **visitation.**

Sometimes, she thought she heard whispers from the sky. Songs from the rust of metal. Footsteps in the radio-static. Sometimes, she welcomed them.

But in the end, for all she ever knew…

…there was no one and nothing left.

Only Katherina.

Stranded in the vast, frigid dead-space—

Ever since the **SUN** departed.

# Chapter Three - The Red King
**KATHERINA SERIES – CONTACT**  
**YEAR OF RECORD:** Mid 1985  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Former Commune Zone, Southern Acid Belt  
**STATUS:** To Be Monitored – Long-Term Psychological Deterioration Logged

---

Katherina lay draped across her narrow bed, limbs slack, eyes fluttering beneath pale lids—half-sunken in sleep, half-hungering still. She had devoured another text from the Venusian archive, a brittle book bound in leather-soft skin, its pages soaked in language that shimmered like oil under her flickering phosphorus light. She’d read it cover to cover, mouth parted in trance, and tossed it into the growing pile beside her—*The Liturgies of the Fleshbound Womb*, or something like that.

The air around her pulsed with faint heat. Her mind flickered between dream and waking.

Then, in the corner of her softening sight—*a shadow.*

First upon her thigh. Then sliding upward across her ribs, to her chest, like a hand made not of matter but *pressure.* The room dimmed further, and the breath in her lungs felt thick with iron. The shadow moved—not quickly, not violently—but *deliberately*, with the certainty of something that had been waiting far too long.

The thunder that once rumbled in the high sky fell silent.

Even the low, constant hum of Venus's acidic winds held its breath.

And in the stillness—beyond the glass of her narrow window, past the ragged clouds of sulfur and rain—stood something massive.

It did not blink. It did not move.  
But it *watched.*

**MARS.**  
The **RED KING**.

And Katherina, paralyzed in that dim room, felt her thoughts collapse like ash. Her skin turned to glass. Her blood grew cold. She tried to scream, to call out, but only breath escaped—wet and useless.

Her hand reached for the knife in the bedside drawer—a rusted little thing, barely sharper than a spoon—but even that small act felt impossible beneath that *gaze.*

And then—like thunder cracking across her bones—a voice:

**"LITTLE GIRL."**

It did not echo through the room.

It echoed through Venus.

Through the soil. Through the metal. Through the marrow of her bones.

Katherina shrieked—a sound ragged and primal, torn from the darkest place inside her. The bedframe shook beneath her, groaning like it too feared what had come.

And again, the voice:

**"YOU RUN TOO FAR IN THE DARK…  
AND YOU GET YOURSELF LOST."**

Something changed. The dream peeled back. This was not a vision. This was not fantasy or delusion or fever-born madness. This was *now.* This was *real.*

Her pleading had been answered—not by the star-eyed mothers, not by the watchers, not by Venus, but by **MARS.**

And he had come in *full.*

The silence thickened. Her chest heaved. The lightbars flickered and dimmed, flickered and died.

And then, softer this time. Like fire warming cold hands:

**"CALM DOWN. I AM WHOLE.  
I CAN MAKE YOU WHOLE."**

Katherina opened her mouth. She did not scream.

She *spoke* to him.

She told him how alone she was. How long she had wandered. How there were no voices left. How she had searched every place, every spot, every echo. How her memories were slipping from her. How she stockpiled rations into boxes and boxes of the stuff. How she no longer remembered the faces of her mothers, or if they had ever loved her, or if they were even real. And how her name is *Katherina*.

She told him how she had waited.

And waited.

And *waited.*

Something inside her soul — *something frayed and near-broken* — stilled.

And then:

**"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME."**

The voice no longer rattled her teeth. The bed no longer trembled.

No one had told her anything like that in so long. Not the stars. Not the transmission beacons she activated every year.

And now here he was.

Something ancient. Something opposite.

But not cruel.

**[VOICE – FEMALE, MID-30s, SMOKY ACCENT]**

*"I used to iron their sheets. Every morning, before shift. You could still smell the oil from the drills when you held the corners."*  

**[LAUGHTER – MULTIPLE WOMEN, DISTORTED]**
 
*"There was a girl in our complex. She'd always tuck her hair in a ponytail, and we’d pass her the ration powder first like she was a captain. One time she traded an entire night's sleep for three hormone capsules smuggled in through Callisto. I never asked how she knew which guards were stupid."*  

*"...She didn’t talk about who she was. She didn’t have to."*  

*"She looked like she was falling apart—like someone who'd survived telling them 'no.'"*

*"She’d go out at night and rewire the speakers. Found tapes, not from SPA, not from anyone official. Songs. Women reading poems. Women screaming. And one time, this woman—hollow voice, flat like concrete—she just says, over and over, distorted in static:*

*‘What they made you isn’t what you are.’"*  

**[AUDIO GLITCH – 13 SECONDS OF SILENCE]**

*"Sometimes a girl would wake up from her dream and start crying before she even opened her eyes. Said she remembered her own death. Said she saw a field, all encased in ice. Said she carved her name into a wall and when she came back, it was already there.*

*"Venus was always too hot for dreams. The walls sweated. The oxygen was thin and bitter. They kept the lights tuned to colors that made you forget time—said it improved productivity. No clocks. No mirrors. Just efficiency."*  

*"When we bled, they made us work with it in. Said it built tolerance. When we cried, they lowered our rations. Said hydration needed incentive."*  

*"...That girl—Flicker, we called her—she never looked hungry, even when she was. She had this way of looking through you."*  

*"She taught us things without saying them. Like how to cough once before a false shift report. How to tell the difference between corrective officers and their inspectors by the shape of their boots. How to leave messages in the scent-coding of cleaning fluid."*  
 
_"After her, it stopped being about escape. It started being about inheritance. About building something that'd last, that **they couldn’t take away from us.**"_  

*"They caught her in 1948. Stripped her naked in front of the wall. Said she was ‘trying to corrupt the servile system.’ But I remember this—she smiled. Even with her jaw busted open. Smiled like she’d already made it out."*  

**[VOICE CRACKLES BACK IN – NEW SPEAKER, YOUNG, BREATHLESS]**  

*"She didn’t just smuggle tapes. She smuggled the idea that we could have voices. She left holes in the walls where we could plant them."*  

_"...I don’t remember her real name. But we called her **Flicker.**"_  

*"And every time they'd raid our dorms for contraband and come back empty handed? Every time they'd drop dead, and the company would file it as 'sudden heart failure'? Every time a girl disappears for three nights and then **doesn't** come back bruised and beaten?"*

**[BOTH SPEAKERS OVERLAP]**

*"That’s Flick."*

**[VOICE – MALE, MID-50s, HOARSE BUT CONTROLLED]**

_“They called it **Asset Conditioning**. I called it paperwork.”_

*“I worked in the Correctional Oversight Department—Venus branch. Mid-floor. Nobody important. My job was to certify the behavioral assessments for serviles who ‘failed compliance.’ Not the punishment. Just the process around it.”*

**[AUDIO: AMBIENT OFFICE NOISE – FAINT PRINTER WHIRR, AIR RECIRCULATORS, DISTANT DRONING]**

*“You’d get these reports—lines of numbers. Emotional volatility, libido productivity, obedience latency, fertility status. It all looked clean. Math always does.”*  
*“The girls weren’t numbers, though. Not really. They were test cases. Every month, they’d slip new protocols into the system. Quietly. No memos. Just new checkboxes.”*

_‘Has she made eye contact for more than 3.4 seconds?’  
‘Has she asked to keep her original name?’  
‘Has she formed unapproved intra-sex bonds?’  
‘Does she exhibit… **independent linguistic framing?**’”_

**[PAUSE – BREATHING AUDIBLY THROUGH NOSE]**

*“You know what ‘independent linguistic framing’ means? It means she used a word we didn’t teach her.”*

*“If the girls scored red on more than two flags, the report went to VAP. From there, I didn’t see anything. Just reassignment notices. Or deletion codes.”*

*“Once, a girl wrote ‘no’ in chalk. On the side of a ration bin. Small, faint. Someone caught it. Her number was V-76-E. I still remember that. VAP came in within the hour. Two guards. One nurse.”*

*“I signed the removal form. I didn’t even have to type it. The system filled it out automatically. Just needed a biometric pulse. I gave it mine.”*

**[AUDIO: PAPER SHUFFLING, THEN A DEEP EXHALE]**

*“They weren’t even hiding it. That was the part that got me. The cruelty wasn’t masked. It was modular.”*

*“There’s this protocol—Section 14/9b. Internal term: ‘Divergent Correctional Intimacy.’ I thought it was slang. Until I saw the documentation. Whole programs designed to ‘test the elasticity of feminine behavioral thresholds.’”*

*“They called it elastic. I called it what it was.”*

*“Rape by spreadsheet.”*

**[AUDIO: CHAIR CREAKING, SLIGHT STATIC]**

*“I don’t expect forgiveness. I don’t expect survival. But I kept one file. Just one. Printed it off and fed it through a trash unit marked for sterilization. Burned the rest.”*

*“This is the only copy.”*

*“I’m sending it now. If you get this, you’re either brave or already damned.”*

*“Do something with it.”*

**[VOICE – FEMALE, LATE 20s, TENDER, SLIGHTLY BREATHLESS]**

*“Her hands were always cold at first. They’d warm up under my ribs.”*

*“We worked opposite ends of the facility. I ran maintenance routing—sixteen hours sorting cables that didn’t go anywhere. She was in the chemical rooms. Breathing bleach like perfume. Hands always cracked.”*

*“There was a chute behind the incinerator vent. No reckorders. No sensors. We’d lie on the steel.”*

**[AUDIO: LOW, METALLIC WIND – DISTANT PIPELINE PRESSURE]**

*“She always came to me marked. Scrapes, heat rash, burn lines where the collar stuck to her. I’d press my mouth to every one. Real gentle. Like I was fixing them.”*

*“We never talked about being lovers. That word didn’t exist down there. But sometimes she’d whisper, real quiet, ‘I want to forget the shift code.’ That meant: don’t stop tonight. That meant: take the whole hour.”*

*“We’d slide the uniforms down to the ankles. Lie face to face. Arms hooked together like netting. We never rushed. The longer we went, the more it felt like we were rebelling. Against everything.”*

_“I remember the first time she cried while she was inside me. Said it felt too real. Said it hurt to feel **wanted** without a clipboard.”_

*“I said I’d write her a report if that helped. Three violations of protocol. Two sustained interruptions. One unsanctioned moan.”*

**[AUDIO: SMALL LAUGHTER – BARELY AUDIBLE. SHARED.]**

*“There were times we didn’t even undress. Just held each other through the fabric. She’d say, ‘If we strip too fast they’ll think we’re working again.’”*  

*“Once, after a double shift, we fell asleep like that. Woke up to sirens. Crawled back to our quarters in opposite directions, grease on our thighs. Didn't speak for a week. Thought maybe we’d been flagged.”*

*“But no summons came. No reassignment. No corrections.”*  

*“We were ghosts again.”*

*“We never got caught. Or maybe we did, and they let it happen. Maybe they needed to know what we’d cling to if left unsupervised.”*

*“She’s gone now. Reassigned. That’s what the docket said.”*

*“But when I lie still enough, I swear I can feel her palm again. Cold at first. Always warming.”*

# Chapter Five - Bedtime Stories
**KATHERINA SERIES – CONTACT – CONTINUED**  
**YEAR OF RECORD:** Mid 1985  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Unknown  
**ANNOTATION:** Expunge All References To Precise Location - Entity Confirmed

_The phosphorus light trembled like a candle lost in a cavernous lung. Outside, the frozen-sulfur wind hissed its muted lullaby. Inside, the air was **thick**—with cold and pressure and the scent of something ancient._

Katherina sat upright upon her narrow bed, posture brittle but poised, facing the frost-veined window like it was an altar. Beyond the fogged pane, in that strange depthless black where the stars had once sung, the shape waited. Not hovering. Not looming.

Simply *there*.

**MARS** had no face—but somehow she could feel the weight of his eyes. The curve of attention. His silence was not absence, but *invitation.*

They *spoke*.

For an hour or more—though time had long since become a concept for the desperate—they traded truths like relics. Her voice was coarse, shaped by long disuse and colder nights. His voice, by contrast, was monolithic. Not loud. *Large.* A sound that filled space and bone and the narrowing corridors of her mind.

She told him of her loneliness. Of the dead cities. The old names. The taste of ration-syrup and the tea that made her weep. She told him of her searching, of the bunkers, the towers, the bones she whispered to. Of her mothers—real or imagined—and of the dreams where hands stroked her hair.

He listened.

And then, somewhere between a laugh and a confession, Katherina made a sly remark—about the *men* of Venus, or rather, the lack of them. The hollow ones, the cruel ones, the weak ones. She spoke of longing. Of hunger. Of the heat between her thighs that not even prayer could soothe.

**MARS** did not pause. He *declared*:

> **"I AM THE PERFECT MAN. I AM THE CONCEPT OF MAN. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE ME."**

His words did not warm her. They *pierced* her. Something inside her clenched—not in fear, but in awe. In recognition.

They discussed this—what it meant to *be* a man, a god, a concept made flesh through will and violence and memory. And desire.

Then she asked about the others.

The voices once heard across the stars. The transmissions. The colonies. The laughter and horror of a species that once scattered like pollen into the cosmic wind.

**MARS** responded like scripture:

> **"THE OTHERS ARE GONE. THEY ABANDONED US."**

She reeled. But not because he knew. Because he *didn’t*. He, too, was unsure. They had simply… vanished.

He repeated, quieter this time, but with twice the weight:

> **"IT’S JUST US NOW.  
> IT’S JUST US NOW."**

The echo sank into her ribs. She nodded.

The conversation twisted again—spiraled downward like a bloody offering down a stone drain.

> **"THEY RAVAGED IT,"**
> **"ALL OF IT. THERE’S NOTHING LEFT."**

War. Starfire. Collapse. The death of Venusian cities, the fracturing of mind and memory and myth.

> **"NOT JUST THE HUMANS.  
> THE STARS TOO, IN THEIR OWN WAY."**

> **"THEIR POINTLESS WARS…  
> THERE’S NOTHING LEFT."**

And that was truth.

Not spoken. *Etched.*

> **"WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.  
> IT’S ALL THEIR FAULT."**

Katherina did not resist this truth. She *absorbed* it. Welcomed it like warmth on a frostbitten palm. Their world—ravaged, starless, orphaned—was still *theirs.*

They spoke further. Of survival. Of purpose. Of becoming more than the echo of a dead race.

And then, **MARS**, with the slow gravity of inevitability, said:

> **"IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY NOW.  
> THIS COLD PLACE IS OUR HOME.  
> WE WILL MAKE IT OUR HOME."**

His voice was not pleading. It was *sovereign.*

She did not hesitate. She understood.

But **MARS** paused—perhaps for the first time—and offered her a way out:

> **"YOU DON’T HAVE TO BURDEN YOURSELF WITH THIS.  
> REMEMBER, YOU CAN BACK OUT ANYTIME."**

Katherina answered without blinking.

> **"I UNDERSTAND."**

A breathless pause followed. The light dimmed further. Outside, the shape in the void seemed to lean *closer.*

And then, softly—like a knife kissing skin:

> **"DO YOU LOVE ME?"**

She blinks.

---

And something comes back. Not all at once—but like a smell remembered from childhood.

A warm lap.  
Fingers combing through her hair.  
A lullaby hummed off-key.  
The feel of soft cloth draped over her cheek while someone whispered:

*"Shh, little one. You're safe. You're loved. Sleep now."*

There were two voices.  
Two women.  
One spoke with a low, scratchy laugh, like gravel and honey. The other was gentler—young, nervous, always fussing over the blankets. One wore thick gloves from working near acid vents. The other always smelled like tea leaves and salt.

They called her their miracle.  
They made her soup.  
They told her stories about stars.

She remembers lying between them in the dark, the hum of a failing generator overhead, feeling them breathe on either side.

*"You're going to be someone,"* one whispered.  
*"You already are,"* said the other.

But then it changes.

A knock on the metal door.  
A flashlight in her eyes.  
Gloves again—but colder this time. Rougher.  
Voices she didn’t recognize.

*"She’s the one."*  
*"Just sedate her."*

She screamed for her mothers.  
She felt the needle.

And then—

Nothing.

When she gasps back into herself, her hands are curled into fists, pressed to her stomach like she’s trying to hold something in. Her breath hitches.

# Chapter Six - Red Sex
**KATHERINA SERIES – PRIVATE SEGMENT**  
**YEAR OF RECORD:** Mid-to-Late 1985  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Unknown  

---

The sex was a little awkward.  

She always felt so *small*.

Not delicate—unfinished.  
Like something made in a hurry.  
Like the shape of her body hadn’t been finalized yet.

She kept trembling, like she wasn’t built for touch.  
Like something had broken and regrown inside her—crooked.

Sometimes it felt like her body was trying to remember someone else’s rhythm.  
Like she was rehearsing pleasure that didn’t belong to her.

Katherina sang sometimes, low and off-key. And she danced. Not like a girl, but like a marionette. Tangled strings, twirling just out of reach, her toes skimming ash.

That skinny, skinny frame…

That tired, tired act…

She's uninteresting wearing all that black.

She wore it like she owed it to someone—maybe to the dead, maybe to Venus herself.

I shouldn't, but I peer into her dreams.

She dreams of before the flash. Of a time when Venus and the **SUN** were close—*intimate*. She says they used to kiss through clouds, through fire. She says Venus was radiant once. That she *glowed*.

And she wonders:

> “If they were so close… why did he leave?”  
>  
> “Was it all the noise, the screaming, the endless bickering?”  
>  
> “Was it the sky, stained and bleeding from all the smog?”  
>  
> “Was it the poison-laced oceans and the endless factories?”  
>  
> “Or was it the tears she shed constantly?”  
>  
> “Did her sorrow deform her?”  
>  
> “Would the **SUN** still make love to her disfigured mantle?”  
>  
> “Did VENUS feel lonely, too?”

 And then she spirals from there…

> “Why is **MARS** always up there?”  
>  
> “Why is he so distant?”  
>  
> “Why won’t he come closer?”  
>  
> “Why is he always red with silence?”  
>  
> “If I kissed him, would I start burning, too?”  
>  
> “I’m his little **SUN**. I’m his little **SUN**…”

That's usually when I shut her up.  
Not out of cruelty.

But because she doesn't know what's at stake.  
How carelessly she could unravel all this carefully-crafted tragedy.

I live in fear.

I live afraid of the moment before consummate disaster—

when my puppet turns to face the puppet master.

# Chapter Seven – Waiting For Black Metal Records To Come In The Mail  
**KATHERINA SERIES – DISSOCIATIVE PHASE**  
**DATE OF RECORD:** Early 1986  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Unknown  

---

Katherina's life had become a joke at her own expense.

Every morning, **MARS** was turned just a little further away.

Not physically—she could still see him, red and glowering through the acid-streaked clouds—but metaphysically, he felt distant. Like he had retracted something. Like his soul had taken one slow, deliberate step back.

Craters like beauty marks. Mountain ranges like deep scars.

The tin box of mixed teabags was nearly empty. That was her one ritual, her one remaining comfort. The flavors bled together, cheap things imported from **JUPITER**'s moons, stale and scentless. Still, she’d let the bag sit in boiled water for exactly five minutes. Five minutes of control. Five minutes of pretending she had a body that wasn’t falling apart.

She subsisted on sugar cubes and rice. Sometimes honey if she rationed right. The sweetness barely registered. She suspected **MARS** liked her thin. Her hip bones stuck out like warning signs. Her wrists could cut.

All the standard phosphorus lights malfunctioned. Gasoline was low to the point where she moved in pitch black, counting steps.

Keeping herself busy with arts and crafts was growing more and more difficult. Drawing had become shameful. **MARS** didn’t like the way she depicted him—said it was "dishonest." Her karaoke was increasingly uninspired. And the monospeaker—*that* speaker—emitted this faint whine, a mosquito in her ear that never died. It broadcast his voice sometimes, or a distorted imitation of it.

He still enjoyed her dancing. Actually, he loved it. Sensual, slow. She danced even when her legs shook. Even when her lungs burned.

She wasn’t sure when the talking stopped.

They used to talk about strange, beautiful things. Cosmic things. Ideas. Symbols. She’d ask questions, and **MARS** would answer in riddles that felt profound.

But even back then, even when he was trying—  
there was something *off*.

---

> She had asked him once, curled in the hangar’s shadowlight,  
> “Why do you never sleep?”
> 
> He didn’t answer at first. He stared.
> 
> **“BECAUSE IF I SLEEP, YOU'LL DREAM WITHOUT ME. AND IF YOU DO IT LONG ENOUGH, YOU WON'T NEED ME ANYMORE.”**
> 
> She laughed, gently.
> 
> But he didn’t laugh back. He whispered, not quite to her:
> 
> **“I WAS MADE TO BE SEEN. IF I VANISH FROM YOUR MIND, I VANISH ALTOGETHER.”**

---

She remembered that now,  
and it scared her more than the speaker ever did.

Because it meant that everything he took from her—her thoughts, her body, her voice—he took *to protect himself*.

And she was too afraid to ask for them back.

His demands came faster. Her mind couldn’t keep up. Sometimes she'd forget her own name.

> *Sex ruins everything that could’ve been beautiful.*

She didn’t remember where she heard that.  
Or if she said it first.  
Maybe it was in a dream.  
Maybe it was a thought Venus once whispered before the **SUN** left her behind.

The worst part was the suspicion. **MARS** had to be hiding something. Behind all the cold lust, behind the obsession—something was *wrong*. She didn’t have the words. She only had a sensation deep in her stomach.

This could not be kept up any longer.

# Chapter Nine - Black Metal Records

**YEAR OF RECORD:** Late 1987  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Unknown 
**CLASSIFICATION:** BLACK CODE - UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL

Tonight was silent.  

He wasn’t speaking tonight.  
Not aloud. Not through the crackling wires, not through the walls or the machines.  
**MARS** didn’t need to anymore.  

He preferred the inside of her skull.

His voice burrowed, uninvited, into her thoughts. Sometimes as words. Sometimes just a pressure behind the eyes.
Some nights, he would press into her muscles, inhabit them, wear her bones like clothes.

Walked her across the room.  
Made her smile.  
Made her beg.  
Made her touch herself.

But tonight?  
Stillness.  

Katherina had learned not to *think*.  

Thinking was dangerous.  
A single wrong phrase, a flicker of doubt—  
and he could be inside her again.  

So she went through the motions.  

As she feigned the usual bedtime routine - brisk dip in the lake, drying off her body and touching up her hair, rubbing some of the local vegetation on her teeth…

She slipped up.  

She had it. She had the thought.

And like a hand to the throat—  
He was there.  

No warning. No chance.  

Her skull *split open* with his voice.  

> **SINNER, WRONG DOER, EVIL DOER, WORKER OF INIQUITY, A BAD EXAMPLE, SCOUNDREL, KNAVE, VIPER, WHORE, BLACK SHEEP, THE DEVIL INCARNATE—**  
> 
> **I LOVED YOU SO MUCH I HAD TO LIVE INSIDE YOU.**  
> 
> **I DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO BE HELD ANY OTHER WAY.**

It wasn’t just noise.  
It was *penetration*.  

He entered her thoughts like a blade.  
Slid into the gaps of her memories.  
Flooded every synapse with his filth.  
Took her body from her, again.  

She felt weak. She felt her legs move without consent. She felt sick to her stomach.
Her mouth twitch. Her spine arch.

_"leave me alone. you have my body already, let the rest of me be"_

But he was inside already.  
And she couldn’t scream without him tasting it.

*“leave me alone. leave me alone. please don't do it again, please, i can't do it anymore.”*

Her voice sounded so far away.

_“leave m_**E ALONE.”**

**“LEAVE ME ALONE.”**

**“MY SOUL IS FLAWLESS AND PURE.”**

**“I DISREGARD THE PRECAUTIONS.”**

And that’s when something would break.
Not inside her.  
*But in the sky.*

**KATHERINA**'s hand rose—unthinking. Instinctual.  
Like Venus herself moved through her veins.  

She struck upward.  

Tore at the heavens with thought turned to weapon.

The sky peeled.  
The stars *shivered*.
Her thoughts ran down, dripped down, became reality.
The curse of the **RED KING**.

And Mars came undone.  

**KATHERINA** pulled him down.  
Ripped him from the black.  
Held him—smaller than ever—in her hand.  

And then—  
**the flash.**

Blinding.
Yellow.
Revealed.

And there it was — what Mars hid all this time. The truth she was *raped* away from knowing.

> The **SUN**.  
> Still shining. Still burning.  
> Hidden behind Mars.  

He had hidden the dawn.  

He stole the light,  
stole the warmth,  
stole *the life itself*—  

—from **KATHERINA**.  
—from *Venus*.  
—from *everyone*.  

Mars had done it.

He had silenced the world in shadow and called it "love."

> Mars wasn’t love.  
> He was *control*.  
> The thing that whispers _“you’ll never be free.”_ 

But **KATHERINA** had ripped him out.  

Mars was responsible.

Mars would be sorry.

Mars was the night, the nightmare.

**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Atmospheric Apex  
**CLASSIFICATION:** BLACK CODE - UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL

---

There is no stage.

Only atmosphere, choking and too still.

The now-yellow clouds of Venus churn far below, but Katherina floats above them—untethered, unread, undescribed.

Her arms are lifted.  
Her hands are open.

Between them glows **Mars**, flickering red, his body dimming like a candle after the storm.

He is not large now.  
Not royal.

Just **held**.

---

He stares at her.

Something in his face wants to believe he’s still beautiful when he begs.

---

**Mars**:  
You’re shaking.

You don’t have to do this.

---

**KATHERINA**:  
**I’M NOT SHAKING.  
I’M *RIPPING IT OUT.*  
THE LAST TASTE OF WHAT YOU PUT INTO ME.**

---

**Mars** (almost soft):  
I came to you.

I loved you. I *chose* you.

Don’t say it meant nothing.

---

She exhales like a woman lowering a weapon.

---

**KATHERINA**:  
**YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE ME.  
YOU CHOSE THE SHAPE I MADE WHEN I SAID YES.**

---

**Mars** (growing agitated):  
You’re twisting it.  
That’s not what it was.

You were radiant. You were soft. You sang. You gave in.

---

**KATHERINA**:  
**BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T,  
YOU WOULD HAVE KEPT GOING  
UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT OF ME BUT THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME.**

---

The air thickens.

He flickers.

---

**Mars** (trembling):  
You think I wanted to hurt you?

You think I was in control?

I wasn’t—

There’s something else—

(swallows hard)

Something behind it all. The pressure. The stage. The *need.*

I thought it was the 𝐅𝐎𝐎𝐋.  
That bastard’s always watching. He never intervenes.

I thought he was writing it all.  
That it was *his will* that I reached for you that way.

But now I’m not sure.  
I don’t think he’s laughing anymore.

---

Katherina watches him carefully.

Something in her jaw is clenched.  
Tight enough to split stone.

---

**KATHERINA** (measured):  
**YOU ALWAYS SAID I LOOKED BEST WHEN I BEGGED.  
WHEN I CRIED.  
WHEN I CAME ON YOUR DEMAND.**

---

Mars closes his eyes.

But the memory still comes.  
And it **trembles** him.

---

**Mars**:  
I needed it to mean something.

The way you looked at me. The way you fit.

It was the only time I felt real.  
Like a god again.

---

**KATHERINA**:  
**YOU WEREN'T REAL.  
YOU WERE A RE-RUN.  
EVERY TOUCH WAS A COPY.  
EVERY KISS CAME WITH A SCRIPT.**

**YOU WEREN'T HOLDING ME.  
YOU WERE HOLDING A MEMORY OF ME WHEN I FIRST BROKE.**

---

He shakes his head.

He doesn’t want this ending.

He wants the performance again.  
Even if it’s hollow.  
Even if it costs her everything.

---

**Mars** (desperate):  
Say my name.

Just say it.

Curse me. Condemn me. Scream it.  

Let it echo. Let it last.

If I vanish without it, I—

I won’t even be a ruin.

---

**KATHERINA** (fury just under control):  
**THAT'S ALL THIS EVER WAS FOR YOU.  
SOMETHING FORCED THROUGH SOMEONE'S MOUTH.  
OVER AND OVER.  
UNTIL THE SOUND MADE YOU FORGET YOU WERE NOTHING WITHOUT IT.**

---

He flickers again.

Like something winding down.

Like *something* looked away, even if for a split second.

---

**Mars**:  
Please.

Please.

I can’t disappear in silence.

---

**KATHERINA**:  
**NO.**

---

A long pause.

Then, very softly—

**KATHERINA**:  
**AND I'M STILL AFRAID OF YOU.  
EVERY TIME YOU'RE NEAR,  
MY BODY GETS READY TO BE TAKEN.**

**Mars** (screaming now):  
SAY IT!  
SAY MY NAME!  
SAY IT YOU—

---

## ∞ Time slows down to a halt.
**∞ The stage flickers.**  
**∞ You make the choice.**
