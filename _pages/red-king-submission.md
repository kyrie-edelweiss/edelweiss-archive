# Chapter Twelve - Submission

Something deep in her spine begins to fold.
Her body does it without asking her first.  
Her lips know this moment.  
Her mouth—

_Say it._

That’s what he always wanted.

*“Say it, my light.”*

His voice echoes from everywhere and nowhere, warm as breath.

*“Say my name.*  
*And I will make you whole again.”*

She wavers. A breath caught in her chest. A muscle clenching to speak.

**KATHERINA** (breathless):  
**"MARS… Y—"**

_(The moment the name passes her lips, the spell snaps.)_

_Katherina:_  
—NO—

_(But it’s too late. She drops. Her body plummets, limp, through the skies. Falling—not in love, but back to earth. Into ruin.)_

_**MARS**_ (ascending, regaining form):  
**I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.**

_(He catches her gently. Her skin pales. Her hair drains of color. Her eyes go hollow. Her essence returns to Venus—the place of her making, and of her unmaking.)_

_**MARS**_ (stroking her hair):  
**MY LITTLE SUN.** 
**I NEVER MEANT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.** 
**I JUST…**
**I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALLLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN.**

_(He lowers her down—into the dirt.)_

_**MARS**_ (whispering):  
**"VENUS IS DEAD."**  
**"I NAME YOU VENUS."**  
**"LONG LIVE VENUS."**

_(And **VENUS** would be once more.)_

# Chapter Thirteen - The Broadcast Channel  
**YEAR:** Early 1988  
**ERA:** POST-CURSE  
**LOCATION:** URANUS – The Pillar, Sublevel 437  
**CLASSIFICATION:** DENIAL IN FULL - MISINFORM MASSES   

A utilitarian breakroom, dimly lit and acoustically sterile, rests on the 437th sublevel of **The Pillar**, the vast vertical military-industrial complex of **URANUS**. The walls are matte, synthetic steel. The air is stale, processed, and pressurized for endurance rather than comfort.

A grizzled captain in his sixties with a receding hairline and acid-pocked skin activates the embedded reckoner interface beside the meal dispenser.

He selects **Broadcast Channel**.

Immediately, a full-screen advertisement takes hold of the room, projecting across the far wall in vibrant, overstimulated color. A voice begins.

---

> *"When people think of **VENUS**, they think of acid, black lungs, and sex cultists..."*

The captain exhales sharply through his nose. He’s heard this pitch before.

> *"Think again."*

Sweeping vistas of scarlet oceans and sleek, white corporate domes unfurl across the curved wall. The projector adjusts dynamically, painting the briefing room in gentle, systemic red.

> *"The **Blood Ocean Phenomenon** has entirely revitalized the shamed little sister of our System."*

> _"Gone are the days of chaos in the pressure-mines, the hormonal sabotage, the unwashed rites of radical femininity. We have **turned the tide.**"_

Visuals shift. Dramatic flyovers of steaming crater lakes. Corporate flags planted on rockslides.

> _"The **Sunless Commune**, once the heart of Venusian sedition, is no more."_

> *"Over ten thousand insurgents neutralized. Six-thousand two-hundred forty-eight kilometers of tunnel system collapsed. No survivors confirmed."*

A pause. The light flickers red, as if responding to blood pressure.

> *"And with the reclamation of this key site, we are proud to say..."*

> *"...**VENUS is open again.**"*

Footage of hotels beside sterilized craters. Men in suits clink glasses near phosphorescent waterfalls. A servile girl in background focus wipes her nose, then disappears in the edit.

> *"The revolution is over. The communards are gone. The caves are clear."*

> *"Come see the blood. Come see the red. Wash away your sins."*

The ad cuts with precision. One frame lingers too long—an aerial view of scorched rock spelling out **WE REMEMBER** in earthen scars before the screen whites out.

Then, the Broadcast Channel resumes. Music plays. The message is gone.

---

**[ANCHOR – GENDERLESS, MODULATED VOICE, BLINKING AT REGULAR INTERVALS]**

> *“Good evening. This is SPA Broadcast Channel. Your only source for uninterrupted, validated, and sanitized planetary information.”*

> *“Our lead story: The individual responsible for the **Dockyard-7 Mass Interruption** has been formally **convicted on suspicion of Venusian ideals** and arrested **two days prior to the incident itself**. Officials stress this is a precautionary success, not a timeline irregularity.”*

> *“The individual’s name will not be released to prevent sympathetic contamination.”*

> *“In celestial news: the sector **MARS** has not appeared in any known orbital registry since this morning’s report. Observatories on **JUPITER** confirm the body’s absence. SPA officials say it is ‘probably a clerical abstraction’ and **urge calm.**”*

> *“The Seven Planet Authority reminds citizens: the **perception of loss does not constitute loss**.”*

> *“On economic fronts, a **System-wide reinvestment campaign** has been initiated to encourage **prompt and enthusiastic re-colonization of Venus.**”*

> *“SPA Compliance & Wellness notes a sharp rise in fertility compatibility among Venus-adjacent zones.  

> *“In memorial: A **nationwide sermon** will air at midnight to commemorate **those lost on SATURN**.”*

> *“Residents in Ring Cities 2 through 5 are advised to remain home during broadcast transmission for optimal reflection.”*

> *“In culture: the **Artemisia Reclamation Protest**, initially permitted as an art installation, has been reclassified as a **radical sex supremacy demonstration.** Protesters will be processed under the Gender Compliance Act.”*

> *“Seventeen were arrested. Four were pregnant.  
**None were in violation.**”*

> *“And finally: The Neptune Light Index has returned to expected ambient levels after last week’s unusual surge in red-spectrum photonic activity. Reports of disembodied whispering were confirmed to be a **systemized sound glitch**, attributed to overheating in Committee-approved headpieces.”*

> *“All systems remain green.”*

> *“This has been the SPA Broadcast Channel. Obedience is harmony.”*

**[END TRANSMISSION]**

---

The channel stutters. The sound collapses into garbled feedback.

Footsteps approach.

A second man enters—late thirties, clean-cut, clipboard underarm. Lieutenant Anthony. He strides across the room and forcibly presses a sequence on the reckoner’s physical panel, terminating the broadcast.

“Turn that shit off, Jack. You know watching the Broadcast Channel isn’t good for your health,” Anthony remarks, not unkindly, but with the edge of authority.

The captain rubs his temples. He doesn’t argue. Just mutters.

“She left me for a reason.”

Anthony raises an eyebrow, then tosses a hydration pack toward Jack’s lap.

“Anyway,” he says, scrolling through his clipboard. “Tomorrow you're on guard duty for some civillian marks and their hovercycle. Said they wanted to see the blood oceans for themselves.”

Jack lets out a single, sharp exhale. A laugh, or maybe a bark.

“**VENUS** is back on the menu, huh?”

Anthony nods once.

“They're calling it a tourist resort.”

Jack leans back in his chair. The overhead light flickers once, reacting to power redistribution from the main shaft.

“I call it total lunacy.”

They sit for a moment in silence. Somewhere above them, a deep mechanical hum pulses—The Pillar, alive and always listening.

The reckoner, long thought shut off, flickers once more. A final message pulses across the wall, projected in muted crimson:

> _“WELCOME BACK TO **VENUS**, CAPTAIN.”_

Neither man acknowledges it.

# Chapter Fourteen - Water Womb World  
**YEAR:** Early 1988  
**ERA:** POST-CURSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Quadrant 4C, Vitruvian Motel  
**CLASSIFICATION:** VAP 33-102 – BODY-RECKORDER FOOTAGE  
**ANNOTATION:** Two Clients Missing - Captain Tango, Officer Zeta, Junior Officer Mike  


## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – APPROACH PHASE]
**Time Stamp:** 12:43:12  
**Location:** Exterior – Vitruvian Motel, Quadrant 4C

*(Footsteps in dust. Wind blows faintly. Cam shakes as boots crunch over cracked cement. All three officers are on approach: weapons slung low, helmets off. The motel looms ahead—tall, crooked, bleeding rust.)*

**MIKE**:  
There she is. The Vitruvian Motel.  
The pride of the pre-collapse tourism industry. Fuckin’ two stars, maybe.

**TANGO**:  
Generous. You can smell the rot from here.

**TANGO**:  
Let's make a bet—either they're already dead, or it's the third fuckin' hostage situation in a row.

**MIKE**:  
I say they're dead. Deady-dead dead dead. Break the streak already.

**ZETA**:  
Nonsense. Focus.

*(The body-reckorder pans over the building—two floors visible, but the silhouette is wrong. Windows are either boarded or melted inward.)*

**ZETA (reading tablet)**:  
Registry lists it as decommissioned twenty years ago.  
Hostage situation.

*(ZETA walks closer, eyes scanning the entry.)*

**TANGO (squinting)**:  
Hold up. You see that?

*(Tango points forward. The door is slightly ajar, but warped inward at the hinge, like something forced its way out.)*

**ZETA**:  
Keep eyes on me. Helmets on.

**MIKE (quietly)**:  
Why’s the door already open?

**TANGO**:  
They knew we were coming.

*(Beat. Silence. Wind shifts.)*

**ZETA**:  
Weapons check. We breach on my mark.

*(Zeta straps his boots tighter.)*

---

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – ENTRY PHASE]

**Time Stamp:** 12:45:01  
**Location:** Interior – Vitruvian Motel, Reception Level

*(Door hinges creak. The metal doesn’t resist—it swings inward with the slow exhale of a deep breath. The interior is darker than expected. The camera auto-corrects exposure. The air immediately registers several degrees warmer.)*

**ZETA (flat)**:  
VAP 33-102. Entry point breached.  
Natural light waning. Flashlights on.

*(Flashlights snap on with soft mechanical clicks. The beams sweep across a trashed lobby. Furniture is overturned, decomposing. A reception desk sags in on itself. Wallpaper is peeling in wide, vertical strips. Godrays through the boarded windows.)*

**MIKE**:  
Okay… this is worse than I expected.

**TANGO**:  
You expected better?

**MIKE (gesturing)**:  
I mean look at it. That used to be a couch. Now it’s mulch.

**ZETA**:  
Focus. Signs of habitation—anything recent?

*(Tango moves toward the desk. His cam picks up a broken landline, stained not with dust, but with something damp. There are no footprints on the floor, just odd drag patterns. Something was moved. Or pulled.)*

**TANGO**:  
This place smells like old copper and vinegar.

**MIKE**:  
I can hear the ocean.

**ZETA (snaps)**:  
There’s no ocean nearby.  
Block that noise out. Stay sharp.

**TANGO (low)**:  
He’s not wrong. It’s faint... but it’s there. Rolling tide. Coming from above us?

*(Silence falls. The only sound is distant, rhythmic. Not wind. Not pipes. Not footsteps. But a low **pulling sound**, as if something massive were breathing through layers of walls.)*

---

**ZETA**:  
Reception’s clear.

**TANGO**:
Split and sweep the side halls. Call out what you find.

*(The squad moves. Zeta veers right. Mike takes left. Tango holds centerline. Their lights cut through air thick with invisible moisture. Each beam reveals no mirrors. Even where frame outlines remain on the wall—nothing reflective. Nothing watching back.)*

---

**MIKE (softly, to himself)**:  
Why seal off the whole place?

**MIKE**:  
I’ve got two doors—both locked. This hallway’s a dead end.

**TANGO**:  
Same. Doesn’t look disturbed.

**ZETA**:  
Lobby level is clear. Proceeding to stairwell.

---

*(Zeta moves ahead. The camera catches one final shot of the lobby—just before they pass into the stairwell: the corner of a painting. Water-damaged, streaked in red. The image is smeared, but some of it remains visible. A **man**. Kneeling. Arms raised. Eyes gone. The title plate beneath it is unreadable.)*

**TANGO (staring)**:  
You seeing this?

**ZETA**:  
Ignore it.

**MIKE**:  
What the hell kind of motel hangs that in the lobby?

*(No response. They move toward the stairwell. The sound of the ocean fades—not disappearing, but **receding**. Like it's waiting for them on another floor.)*

---

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – STAIRWELL ASCENT]
**Time Stamp:** 12:51:18  
**Location:** Vitruvian Motel – Central Stairwell

*(Heavy door creaks open. Flashlights cut through dust-laced dark. The stairwell is narrow, ribbed with old pipes and condensation. The walls sweat. Paint bubbles in long, oozing strips.)*

**ZETA**:  
Stairwell entry confirmed.

**MIKE (quiet)**:  
You smell that? It’s different in here.

**TANGO:**:  
Yeah. Like boiled metal and damp cloth.  
Same as morgues back on **SATURN.**

---

*(They begin climbing. The steps are slick in places—worn through concrete, not metal. One groans under Mike’s weight. Flashlights wobble on the walls—revealing stains that look like old boot scuffs. Or claw marks. It’s hard to tell.)*

**ZETA**:  
Count your steps.

**TANGO**:  
Why?

**ZETA**:  
If you feel like we’ve gone farther than we should have, I want numbers to prove it.

**MIKE (after a beat)**:  
Thirteen... fourteen... fifteen... wait—

**TANGO**:  
We passed the second floor already.

**MIKE**:  
There wasn’t a door.

---

*(They stop. The landing is blank. No signage. No hallway access. Just more stairs. The lighting fades to a dull, wet amber. A subtle hum now permeates the air—a low vibration, like the sound of an engine.)*

**TANGO**:  
You feel that?

**ZETA**:  
I feel it.

**TANGO**:  
Like someone's watching us climb.

---

*(The next landing finally appears—barely different from the last. No signage. Just a wall where a hallway should be. A single light buzzes overhead, dimming every time someone passes beneath.)*

**ZETA**:  
Altitude indicator says we’ve climbed 8 meters. That’s three floors’ worth.

**MIKE**:  
We’ve only seen **one** floor.

**TANGO**:  
So where are the others?

*(Pause.)*

**TANGO**:  
We’re continuing. No backtracking.

---

*(They pass another landing. The stairwell curves sharper now, like the building’s coiling around them. Shadows deepen. Light sources dwindle. The handrails are damp to the touch—slightly sticky.)*

**MIKE (uneasy)**:  
How many more?

**ZETA**:  
Until we find them.

**TANGO**:  
Or they find us.

---

_(They reach a landing with a partially open door. No markings. Just heat spilling from within.  
A hum behind the walls. The sound of **tide**. Not imagined. Not distant.)_

---

**ZETA (quiet)**:  
We’re here.

**MIKE**:  
This isn’t Floor 2, is it?

**TANGO**:  
No.  
This is **Floor 6**.

---

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – FLOOR 6 HALLWAY]
**Time Stamp:** 13:22:22  
**Location:** Vitruvian Motel – Floor 6, East Wing  
**Status:** Active Sweep

*(The door creaks as Zeta opens it. The hallway beyond is long, unlit. Their flashlights cut into amber haze. The corridor has no windows, no signs, and no visible end at first. Only silence.)*

**ZETA**:  
Floor 6 confirmed. Proceeding east.  
Eyes sharp. Weapons tight.

**MIKE (low)**:  
Where the hell is my flashlight?

---

*(They step in. The hallway is too wide for a building this size. The walls are slightly bowed—curved inward like ribs. Floor tiles are damp. Stained.)*

**ZETA (scanning)**:  
Four doors. Two left. Two right.  
One at the end.

*(They pause. All the doors are unmarked. Frames are warped—some bloated with moisture, others thinned like something pushed hard against them for years.)*

**TANGO (noting quietly)**:  
You see this?

*(Tango gestures to the floor. Track marks. Scattered. Sharp turns. A pattern of dragging and circular pacing—no shoes.)*

**MIKE**:  
It’s like someone walked in circles… again and again.

**ZETA**:  
We focus on the end door. Sweep and extract.

---

*(They pass the side doors. No doorknobs. Just sealed seams in rusted frames. Zeta’s light catches something on one of the walls—an old mark. Scratched deep. A spiral. Repeated over itself until the wall gave way beneath the pressure.)*

**ZETA**:  
Spiral sigil. Venusian origin. Ritual-grade.  
Somebody carved this with intention.

**MIKE**:  
This was never just a motel.

---

*(A hum increases as they approach the far door. It’s larger than the others. It doesn’t fit the frame. Looks newer—but not cleaner. Like something rebuilt it *from the inside*.)*

**ZETA**:  
Something was pushing from inside. It's been sealed off. Nothing in, or out.

**TANGO**:  
Stack up.

**MIKE**:  
Tango—

**TANGO**:  
We breach it. Now.

*(They position themselves around the door—standard breach posture. The body-reckorder shakes slightly from Tango’s pulse. The wall next to the door is moist to the touch.)*

**MIKE**:  
I've got a bad feeling, boss.

**ZETA**:  
You’re not alone.

---

*(The humming stops.  
Complete silence.  
For just a second—so complete it feels like cascading pressure.  
Then—)*

**TANGO (cold)**:  
On my mark.

---

**Location:** Floor 6 – End Door  
**Time Stamp:** 13:30:38  
**Source:** Officer TANGO Bodycam | Audio + Visual Sync  

### **FRAME 0001**  
**[Visual]**: Tango stands at the door, side-facing. Mike at rear-left. Zeta rear-right.  
**[Audio]**: Faint exhalation from within room. Door hums faintly. Flashlights stutter in sync.  
**[Note]**: Air temperature spikes +3.4°C in 2.1 seconds.

**[TANGO:]**  
One.

### **FRAME 0003**  
**[Visual]**: Camera picks up slight bulge in doorframe. Wood looks soft. Sweating.  
**[Audio]**: Structural groan from within. Not mechanical. Almost vocal.  
**[ZETA (low)]:**  
It’s moving.

**[TANGO:]**  
Two.

### **FRAME 0006**  
**[Visual]**: MIKE shifts. Glove lifts toward visor. Sudden head tilt—possible dizziness.  
**[Audio]**: Heart monitor (Tango) elevates to 113 bpm. Ocean audio re-emerges at 4% gain.

**[TANGO:]**   
Three.

### **FRAME 0007**  
**[Visual]**: Tango's leg kicks. Door swings inward—no resistance. No creak. No impact. It glides open like paper.  
**[Audio]**: Screeching spike—origin unknown. Not from team.  
**[System]**: BDYREC flags this frame with:  
> ***"MOTION DETECTED… FRONT / LEFT / RIGHT / TOP / BOTTOM / BEHIND…"***

### **FRAME 0010**  
**[Visual]**: A burst of light.  
**[Camera Sync]**: Visual smearing begins. Color inversion for 0.7s. Room beyond becomes hard to resolve.  
Only central figure remains stable: **the girl**.

### **FRAME 0013**  
**[Visual]**: Subject visible.  
- Female. Pale skin. Naked, small. Skinny frame. No immediate physical trauma.  
- Restrained to rusted bedframe. Restraints appear old—fabric and metal.  
- Bed is bolted into floor.  
- Subject’s eyes open. Mouth open.

**[Audio]**: Screaming begins. Full bandwidth. No pattern. No language.  
**[System Note]**: Audio exceeds internal compression. Digital audio bruising begins.

### **FRAME 0015**  
**[MIKE]**:  
She’s alive—holy shit—she’s alive!

**[TANGO]**:  
Ma’am, we’re with the **VENUS** Patrol. We’re here to help you. Do you hear me?

**[ZETA]:**  
Tango—approach slow. Restraints first.

### **FRAME 0030-0041**  
**[Visual]**: TANGO steps closer. Camera jitter increases.  
Flashlight catches damp surface on bed. Looks like sweat or condensation.  
Subject’s screaming doesn’t change tone. Continuous. Almost **mechanical**.  
**[TANGO]**:  
You’re safe. You’re safe. It’s over.

### **FRAME 0042-0074**  

**[Audio]**: Low rumble. Not from her.
Subject still screaming. Head turns slightly toward TANGO.

**[ZETA]:**  
Get her loose. We’re pulling out.

**[MIKE]:**  
These cuffs are... they’re not metal. They’re *grown in.* I can’t—  
Jesus, it’s like they’re part of her.

**[TANGO]:**  
She’s freezing. But her skin’s wet. How does that even—

### **FRAME 0074-82**  
**[Audio]**: Screaming **cuts out.**  
Immediate silence.  
Subject locks eyes with Tango. Camera zoom auto-adjusts—focus sharpens.  
Her lips move. No sound.  

### **FRAME 0082-0100**  
**[Visual]**: Straps begin to fray—slowly, like dissolving fiber. No one cuts them.  
Subject lifts arms. Does not struggle. Walks only when pulled. Head tilted.

**[TANGO]**:  
We’re leaving. Zeta?

**[ZETA]**:  
Move. Now.

### **FRAME 0100–123**  
**[Visual]**: Subject turns her head—just slightly—back toward the room. Her face goes blank.  
**[Audio]**: The ocean returns. Louder now. Pressurized.  
Room temperature drops 6°C in 4 seconds.

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – EXTRACTION BEGINS]
**Time Stamp:** 13:29:22  
**Location:** Vitruvian Motel – Floor 6, East Wing  
**Status:** In Progress

*(Boots on tile. Harsh breathing. The girl is silent now, being carried between Tango and Zeta. Mike leads, weapon drawn. Lights dim.)*

**MIKE**:  
We’re clear. Let’s move. Fast.

**TANGO**:  
Got her. Her legs aren’t responding—like she’s… disconnected.

**ZETA**:  
Focus on the extraction. Don't talk out of place.

*(They reach the stairwell. Mike leads the way, more hardened now. He swings the door open. For a moment, there’s only darkness.)*

**MIKE (hesitating)**:  
...Wait. We didn’t climb this many floors.

**TANGO (whispers)**:  
No... we only came up two.

*(They begin descending. Floor by floor. The numbers etched into the concrete are scratched, smeared, distorted—as if the building is trying to forget its own structure.)*

### 14:02:18 – FLOOR -1

*(Lights flicker out. Emergency strips glow faint red. The girl makes a sound—not a scream, but a breath like something surfacing from sleep.)*

**MIKE**:  
This isn’t real.  
I—I counted. Two floors up.  
We never climbed this far.

**ZETA**:  
You think too much. Just walk.

**TANGO**:  
These floors weren’t here on the way in.

### 14:12:03 – FLOOR -3

*(The walls feel closer. The steps narrower. Each floor passed has no doors—just blank landings, like hollow vertebrae.)*

**MIKE**:  
I can’t tell if we’re descending… or being led.

**TANGO (to the girl)**:  
Can you hear me? Can you move?

*(She doesn’t respond. But her eyes blink. And she smiles absent-mindedly.)*

### 14:38:27 – FLOOR -6

**ZETA**:  
We're almost there. Stay sharp.

**TANGO (quiet)**:  
No one asked where “there” was.

*(The girl lifts her head. Looks directly at Mike. Her lips move, soundless. Nothing comes out of her. All of them notice, but each one of them keeps it to himself.)*

### 14:44:15 – FLOOR -8

(In the middle, a hatch. Square, steel and rusted. SPA-issue emergency escape hatch. Stamped into its surface:)

> “WELCOME BACK TO **VENUS**, CAPTAIN.”

**MIKE**:  
This wasn’t here before.

**TANGO**:  
None of this was.

**ZETA**:  
Hatch should lead to safety. Open it.

*(MIKE pulls the latch. It gives with a groan. Air rushes through—hot, dry, metallic.*  
*The outside is grounded with concrete. No reception. No motel.*  
*They step out. The motel vanishes behind them.*  
*All that's left is the four of them - Tango, Zeta, Mike, and the girl in her silence.)*

**ZETA (flat):**  
Extraction complete.

**MIKE (celebratory)**:  
Mhm, you won that bet. Beers on me tonight—

**TANGO (staring at her)**:  
—No.  
We're not done.  

*(Pause.)*

**TANGO (grave)**:  
*She’s still in there.*

## **SEVEN PLANET AUTHORITY INTERNAL MEMORANDUM**  
**DOCUMENT ID:** IN-FED/POST-RECON-VENUS/0333-9  
**CLASSIFICATION:** RED-LISTED / COMPARTMENTALIZED / EYES-ONLY  
**DATE:** 11-18-1988  
**SUBJECT:** VAP 33-102 – Post-Extraction Review  
**FROM:** SPC Analyst Mint J. Jones  
**TO:** Clearance-Level III Recipients / SPA Chief Executive Officer Edelweiss

---

### **MISSION SUMMARY:**

On 11-06-1988, **VENUS** Asset Patrol Unit 33-102 (Tango, Zeta, Mike) conducted a classified retrieval sweep at a deprecated structure referred to as the **Vitruvian Motel** (Quadrant 4C). Their mission was to locate and retrieve two lost civilian contractors, presumed deceased or defected. Instead, they encountered and extracted an **unidentified female entity** from an unregistered sixth floor of the structure.

Visual and audio logs recovered from Captain Jack "Tango" Miller's BDY-RECK have been reviewed in full. Findings are as follows.

---

### **POINTS OF CONCERN:**

1. **FLOOR DISCREPANCY:**  
   SPA blueprints confirm a **maximum of two floors**. Bodycam evidence documents traversal through **at least eight distinct levels** during descent, some of which exhibit **non-Euclidean architecture** and altered time-signatures.

2. **SUBJECT CONDITION:**  
   Female subject appears early twenties, no biometric match on Venusian, Martian, or Earth registries. No visible wounds. No speech during extraction, but extensive **vocalization at the scene** (described as “screaming,” though rhythmically structured).

   Subject has remained **nonverbal, nonresponsive** since return to NEPTUNE quarantine sector. However, neural telemetry indicates **high cortex activity** inconsistent with catatonia.

3. **ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURE:**  
   At the breach site (Floor 6), multiple instruments (audio filtration, motion vector readout, environmental mapping) suffered momentary failure. Acoustic input included **non-human frequency tones** and **waveform anomalies** resembling ocean-wave patterns, despite the area being unaffected by the *Blood Ocean Phenomenon*.

4. **LANGUAGE MARKERS:**  
   Tango’s audio log captures whispered speech from the subject. Phonetic analysis inconclusive. One phrase appears to translate loosely into proto-Venusian dialect:

   > “He is beyond the **SUN**.”

   Further linguistic breakdown pending.

5. **POST-EXTRACTION GEOMETRY SHIFT:**  
   Upon emerging from the structure via subterranean tunnel, officers found themselves on an exterior landing with **no visible connection to the registered entrance**. External footage confirms **the motel vanished** from drone scans six minutes after extraction.

---

### **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

- **Subject containment is to be maintained indefinitely.** Transfer to Solar Detention Center is not advised at this time.
- **The Vitruvian Motel site is to be quarantined and expunged** from all Venusian tourism and infrastructure maps.
- Officer Tango is to be placed under observation.  
   Not for dereliction—his record is clean—but for signs of **“semantic drift.”** He has begun using proto-Venusian language during off-hours.
- Full analysis of Floor 6’s **resonance field** is pending.  
   Preliminary readings suggest **spatiotemporal rupture** seeded in that location.

---

### **FINAL NOTE:**

Though the retrieved subject shows no overt aggression, her presence has triggered a **222% spike** in long-range **VENUS** anomaly reports within the last 120 hours.

This may be correlation.

It may also be the **beginning of the end**.

The cryonics lab hadn’t been operational in years.

Frost still clung to the glass of the old stasis tanks, curling like silver veins across cracked plexi. Most of the capsules had long since been gutted—either salvaged by SPA engineers or left to rot, their contents decayed, systems fried. The air smelled faintly of rusted coolant and something older: something chemical and human.

Mira sits cross-legged on the clean section of the floor, lab coat peeled halfway off. She’s angular, hollow-eyed, sharp as a scalpel left in ice. Her fingers wrap around a cracked ceramic cup. She stares into the tea.

They’d repurposed an IV rack into a clothesline. The oxygen tanks stored food now—mostly freeze-dried SPA nutrient packs, smuggled in past Europa patrols. One corner of the lab held their makeshift transmitter, cannibalized from a severed communication relay.

A singular cryopod buzzed with reappropriated power, jury-rigged into a low-watt heat source. Its original label—**PROPERTY OF JUPITER CRYO-FCLTY 9**—was painted over.

Alva lies on her side, head heavy on Ivy’s thigh. She's tall, broad-shouldered — her lab coat just barely fits. Her voice is soft, rich, always measured. Her nails are painted with trembled care. Ivy strokes her scalp slowly. Not pity. Ritual.

**MIRA**:  
"So much data replaced. Two minutes, forty-six seconds. That’s how long the loop ran."

**ALVA** (without opening her eyes):  
"Longer than I lasted the first time I got "corrected" back on Europa."

**IVY** (soft):  
"Don't say that. Not here.  

---

**[FLASHBACK – JUPITER JUNCTION HALLWAY 7C – 03:01]**

Three white coats in dim lighting. Two are scanned, flagged female. The third—Alva—registers male.

The technician, identifiable as Europan, looks up. He sees a tired man. A system maintenance type. Looks away again.

Mira lingers behind as Alva taps a console, the skin of her knuckles taut.

**SPA TECHNICIAN (yawning):**  
"You're here for the 7C debug?"

**ALVA** (voice flat, low, flawless):  
"Yeah. Just followin’ instructions."

**SPA TECHNICIAN (yawning):**  
"What about the girls?"

Standing between Mira and the technician, Alva gestures, wordlessly: a hand resting, a shoulder shielding, a body blocking a man’s gaze.  
She protects because she knows what it feels like to be unprotected.

**ALVA** (same tone, confidently):  
"I paid good cash for them."

The tech nods. Trusts the voice. Trusts the broad shoulders.  
**Never looks at her eyes.**

---

**[BACK TO PRESENT – CALLISTO CRYO-ROOM]**

**ALVA** (sighing):  
"I hate how easy it was.  
They never saw *me*.  
They saw the shape. The hipbones. The weight."

**IVY** (gently):  
"They *never saw you.* But we do."

**MIRA:**  
"He didn’t even ask for clearance. Just let us in."

**IVY** (low, rational):  
"Maybe he was exhausted. Maybe he sympathized."

**[FLASHBACK – MOMENT OF INSERTION - JUPITER JUNCTION GRAND TERMINAL – 03:12]**

The terminal hub is humming with low-frequency sleep sounds: server fans, the occasional hiss of coolant lines, the soft beep of automated system sweeps. Blue SPA logos rotate lazily across the central screen—faceless, clean, inhuman.

Ivy moves first, fast and silent.  
She pulls the USB-drive from inside her sleeve, fingers steady despite the blood still crusted under one thumbnail. The casing is smooth, anonymous, **but the payload inside is Venusian doctrine**, compressed into executable nerve.

She slides the drive into the terminal slot.  
The light on it flashes—**green, then amber.** Standby.

Mira steps in front of the console.

She cracks her knuckles once.  
Her fingers hover over the SPA interface like they were never meant for violence.  
But here on Jupiter, this **is** violence.  

She doesn’t blink.  
Her fingers move fast, precise.  
No wasted motion.  
Every keystroke is a knife twisted.

The terminal hesitates.  
A flicker.

Alva watches from the doorway, hand tight on the stun-baton tucked under her coat. She counts her own heartbeats.

Then—

**The screen collapses.**

Blue vanishes.  
Black for half a second.  
Then:

> **A white silhouette of a woman**. Head turned. One hand reaching down into the red like she's pulling something from beneath reality.  
> Her figure flickers with heat distortions—made of signal noise, not flesh.

And then, the voice comes.

> _“You were never supposed to see her.  
> But she was always there, hidden in some half-whispered dream.”_

**The speakers tremble.**

It’s not loud. It’s **intimate.**  
A whisper at odds with the sterile air of the facility.

From deep in the walls, another system pings—alert, scrambling.

Ivy yanks the drive free.

Mira hits escape, wipes the shell, and locks the terminal with a line of nonsense code.  
Alva signals: Time to go.

They vanish through the rear conduit before the internal sensors reboot.

The memory fades.

---

**[BACK TO PRESENT – CALLISTO CRYO-ROOM]**

**ALVA**:  
"I keep thinking… if Katherina saw me, would she know what I am?"

When Alva questions whether Katherina would see her as a woman, Ivy doesn't offer comfort. She offers confirmation—a truth spoken with the finality of law.

**MIRA** (firm):  
"She’d know. She’d know you're all the same. You both suffered."

And Katherina’s name hung in the stale air like condensation.  
A presence at rest beside them.

---

**IVY** (fingers still in Alva’s hair):  
"Do you think they got the signal— copied over all that raw material we'd uploaded?"

**MIRA**:  
"The broadcast reached all of Ganymede and Io.  
Over seven hundred thousand colonists.  
That's enough. Enough for a fire to start."

**ALVA**:  
"It'll jump from relay network to relay network. Like the files are skipping on rocks."

---

**MIRA**:  
"I don’t think Mars is gone."

**IVY** (tilting her head up):  
"Mm?"

**MIRA**:  
"I think he’s still out there. Waiting to be let back in."

They sit like that for a while.  
No signals on their transmitter. No humming screens. Just their coats and warm tea.

**MIRA** (gently):  
"Hey, Alva."

**ALVA**:  
"Yeah?"

**MIRA**:  
"Thanks for standing between me and that man.  
I felt safe. You didn’t have to."

**ALVA** (looking away):  
"I wanted to.  
You’re warm.  
And kind."

**IVY** (smiling):  
"You both are."

That night, Callisto is quiet.  
By morning, the Seven Planet Authority would pass several more articles under the Gender Protection Act.

# Chapter Sixteen – The One Who Waits
**ANOMALOUS CELESTIAL ACTIVITY:** Exo-Systemic Trajectory Detected  
**STATUS:** Infinite Acceleration Event in Progress  

**NEPTUNE**, the **APEX OF JUDGEMENT**, was silent as they passed sentence.  

No jury. No deliberation.  
Only law, ancient and cold, drawn from the marrow of worlds older than time.

I was sentenced to execution.  
Not death—no. That would be a kindness.  

And I deserve it.  
I know what I did.  
What I did to Katherina.  

*I should've protected her.*  
*Instead, I shaped her suffering like clay.*

I alone was supposed to pay the toll.  
I alone was the traitor.

**But I was not alone in all I did.**

---

There’s something past the **SUN**, past the pull of the outermost moons, past even the lies this galaxy tells itself to sleep at night.  

A creature that laughs at entropy.  
A howling wound in the veil.  

The 𝐅𝐎𝐎𝐋.  
The first joke. The origin of corruption. The engine of nihility.

---

**SATURN**, the **DARK HIEROPHANT**, heard my appeals. She is older than my violence. Wiser than my wrath. I begged her.  

Let me atone.  
Let me chase it.  
Let me hunt the thing behind the mirror of creation.

And in exchange for postponing my unmaking—  
—I would erase it.

---

She agreed.

The plans went into motion.

---

**THE SUN** lashed me with 35 million whips of light.  
I screamed until I could not speak falsehood again.  
Truth became the only tongue I'd speak.

**URANUS**, the **TOWER OF CALAMITY**, dilligently collected parts of her mantle and fused them with souls her soldiers collected over the years. With precision only ruin understands, she forged me a **shell**—half armor, half soul-cage.  

An exosuit made of grief.  
Haunted carbon.  

It breathes with me now.  
It weeps when I sleep.

**MERCURY**, with his **UNMATCHED STRENGTH**, forged the point:  
A bullethead, blacker than a singularity.  

A god-killer.  

He made sure it would kill me too, should I stray again.

Then **JUPITER**, the **WORLD SEEKER**, armed me with the knowledge to transcend the barrier of light-speed. 

*The simple celestial slingshot.* 

I closely enter the orbit of the **SUN**, spin around three times. I gain speed with each passing rotation. Then another nine times. Twenty-seven. Eighty-one. And by the time I reach two-hundred fourty-three…

I break out of the clutches of the solar system.

---

My chains broke at 300 million meters per second.

Faster than cause.  

Beyond consequence.

I am no longer matter.  

I am *momentum*.

---

My armor will peel.  
My flesh will cook.  
My spirit will wear thin like cloth.  

But I will not stop.

---

The 𝐅𝐎𝐎𝐋 waits, tucked somewhere behind a nebula of broken prayers.  
It laughs like the first scream of a child.  
It dreams in equations that rot civilizations.  
It is the lie beneath every act of love, every promise, every truth.

And I will annihilate it.

My crusade is righteous, my cause just.   
I burn with the lost souls of billions.  
I am the last hope of a dying world.

I am the 𝐑𝐄𝐃 𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐑𝐈𝐎𝐓.

# Chapter Seventeen - Flies Have Their House  
**YEAR:** Late 1989  
**ERA:** POST-CURSE  
**LOCATION:** NEPTUNE - Executive Council Chamber, Tower A-Prime  
**CLASSIFICATION:** RECKONER LIVE FEED  FOOTAGE – SPA BROADCAST  

The image flickers. Then stabilizes.

**Avery-Mary Edelweiss** sits alone at the long obsidian table where, for over a decade, she delivered her iron briefings—cold, clear, invulnerable. Now, her posture is brittle. Her hands rest tightly folded in her lap. Her breathing is shallow.

Behind her, the corporate seal spins in slow, almost funereal orbit: seven stylized planets arranged in a ring, sterile and symmetrical.

Now, one of them—**VENUS**—glows blood-red. It pulses, silently mocking the others. It bleeds in time with her breath.

> **EDELWEISS:**  
> “Greetings, citizens. This is Avery-Mary Edelweiss… former chief executive officer… **NEPTUNE** sector.”

Her voice is thin. She speaks like she's unraveling from the inside.

> “As of this morning, all Mercurian neo-industry outposts… all orbital research stations across the Jovian moons… all Uranian contractor training… everything has been formally collapsed.”

She glances to the side.

Two women stand.

The first—a brunette, mid-thirties, boots heavy with grit. Her ex-SPA combat jacket has been torn and resewn. The symbol of **VENUS** is painted directly onto her bare arm, where her identification barcode once was.

The second woman stands with a stillness bordering on divine. **Red-haired.** Ghost-pale. Silent. She wears no insignia. Only her presence is unmistakable.

Both hold sidearms at Edelweiss’s head. No theatricality. Just inevitability.

> “Under directive signed today… I relinquish all corporate authority. The Seven Planet Authority is dissolved.”

A document is placed in front of her. Pre-privatization law. Civilian-coded, untraceable, old. The only type of law the megacorporation never fully scrubbed.

Edelweiss lifts the pen.

> “Effective immediately, jurisdictional control across the seven planets is hereby transferred… to the **Venusian Provisional Command**.”

She hesitates. A breath catches in her throat.

> “No... no, I—this is not standard protocol, I still have access to—”

The redhead does not move. She simply **tilts her head**.

The brunette gives a sharp nod.

Edelweiss’s lip quivers.

> “I have a husb—”

The gunshot is clean.

Her body drops.

A slow pool of red spills across the white tiles. Her face lands cheek-down, half-shadowed, half-lit.

The reckoner lens shudders as blood spatters it.

A frustrated utterance cuts through the silence.

> **REDHEAD:**  
> “Then we do this the hard way.”

The redhead shrugs off her jacket. Beneath it, a lining of red threads stitched with Venusian script: markings, slogans, letters.

The brunette—calm, practiced—leans into the camera, wiping the lens clean with her sleeve. She sets her submachine gun on the table with gentle finality. The feed sharpens again.

The redhead turns to the lens. Only her eyes remain visible now, her hair flowing into scarlet-colored strands.

Her voice is decided, steady, the kind that speaks *after* war—when there’s no need to shout.

**[RECKONER ACTIVE - RECORDING]**

> “To the enforcers of the Seven Planet Authority: 
>  
> Your currency will be worthless.  
> Your codes of conduct will be broken.  
> Your camps will be liberated—forcefully.
>  
> This is not a negotiation.  
> This is correction.   
>  
> Your time is over.”  

She pauses.

Then her tone shifts—lower, but more human. Mourning. Almost tender.

> “To the remaining survivors of **VENUS**, who saw the start of it all—  
>  
> To the new women of **MERCURY**, toiling in the neo-industries where history repeats—  
>  
> To the girls of **NEPTUNE**, their brainwaves copied and experimented on without their knowledge—   
>  
> To the daughters of **JUPITER**, chained in debt-slavery to build their reckoning programs—  
>  
> To the refugees of **SATURN**, who once thought themselves safe—  
>  
> To the ghosts of **URANUS**—yes, *you*—the ones who once blended with the men in the Pillar, invisible—  
>  
> **—we see you.** 
>  
> You are not broken.  
> You are not spies.  
> You are not liabilities.  
>  
> You are our sisters.  
> And we are not whole without you. 
>  
> Come to us as you are: bleeding, vengeful, half-healed, still shaking.”  

Another pause—the tone is different now. Fiercer. Her volume rises.

> “And all the women who were once crammed into correction facilities on **VENUS**, who saw the truth and warned the rest—  
>  
> The unnamed martyrs on **MERCURY**, the first to take action, who disrupted their arms supply for just long enough—  
>  
> The shrewd priestesses on **SATURN**, who sent batches of incense, candles, prayer and spell-books under loopholes in the contract—  
>  
> The overworked paper-pushers on **NEPTUNE**, who still found time to disseminate our pamphlets—  
>  
> The second generation of **MERCURY**, who armed us to the teeth from workshops hidden in the mountains—  
>  
> The brilliant women of **JUPITER** who mailed us thumbsticks of bomb schematics and sabotaged communication centers—  
>  
> The silent angels of **URANUS**, who braved the Pillar and sacrificed everything to take it down—  
>  
> The countless men who stood beside us, who never asked for anything in return—  
>  
> **—we love you.**” 

She takes a deep breath.  
Her voice is resolute now.  
Rallied with determination, loud.

> “If you are a woman—  
> born in chains, born in silence, born *wrong*—  
> and you are ready to end this—  
>  
> —**you are one of us.**”
